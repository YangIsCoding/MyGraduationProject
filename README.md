# MyGraduationProject
 My graduation project is creating a fitness website.
 You can first go to main->dist->index.html to open up the main page of the website.
 If you want to check out more information you can open up ReadMe.pptx and go to discussion to see how we created the website.
 For the analysis of the website, it's in the final_report pdf.
